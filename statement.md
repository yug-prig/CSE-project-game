Problem Statement
. Users currently lack a unified, lightweight platform to access multiple classic logic games instantly.
. There is a need for a single console-based interface that consolidates various entertainment options without complex installation or graphical requirements.

Scope of the project
. The project involves developing a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) Arcade.
. It integrates four distinct game modules—Number Guessing, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, and Rock-Paper-Scissors—into a single executable script featuring a main navigation menu, input validation, and specific game logic (RNG, turn-management, and scoring).

Target users
. Casual Gamers: Users seeking quick, text-based retro entertainment.
. Python Learners: Students studying control flow, loops, and function implementation.
. CLI Enthusiasts: Users who prefer terminal-based applications over GUI software.

High-level feature
 . Unified Menu System: A central loop allowing seamless navigation between different games.

. Randomization Logic: Implementation of RNG for unpredictable outcomes in guessing and strategy games.

. Game State Management: Logic to track turns (Tic-Tac-Toe), lives (Hangman), and scores (Rock-Paper-Scissors) in real-time.
