#  Python Multi-Game Arcade

A text-based console application that bundles four classic mini-games into a single interactive experience. This project demonstrates core Python concepts including loops, conditionals, functions, error handling, and the random module.

3.  * Rock-Paper-Scissors*: Play against the computer with score tracking.
4.  *Hangman*: Guess the hidden programming-related word before you run out of attempts.

##  Prerequisites

* *Python 3.x* installed on your machine.
* No external libraries are required (uses the standard random module).
